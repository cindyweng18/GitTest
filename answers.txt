1. Sublime lets you choose a variety of programming languages to code with. With that, it is flexible since a computer scientist should not know only one language but probably more than that.

Sublime also does not fill in as most editors do with coding. It can be inefficient and time-consuming but I believe that it makes me learn the code better than other text editors that automatically fill in statements and functions.

Last but not least, Sublime allows you to easily jump to any functions you have written. Programming languages such as Python where for a beginner, the file can be up to 600 lines for a project, it can get tiresome to scroll up and down and carefully look for your function and see what it does. 
2. touch a.txt

touch b.bak

touch c.py

ï»¿find . \( -name "*.txt"\) -exec mv new_a.txt {} \;

find. \(-name "*.bak"\) -exec rm {} \;

if [ cat c.py | wc -l -ge 10 ] 

then

    mv c.py long_c.py

else

    mv c.py short_c.py

fi
